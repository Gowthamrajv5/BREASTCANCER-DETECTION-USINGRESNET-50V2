# BREASTCANCER-DETECTION-USING RESNET-50V2
BREAST CANCER DETECTION USING RESNET-50V2:A  STUDY BASED ON THE RSNA MAMMOGRAPHY DATASET
 Breast cancer is a prevalent form of cancer among women, and early detection plays a crucial role in
 improving patient outcomes. In recent years, deep learning models have shown promise in medical
 imaging applications, including breast cancer diagnosis. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of
 the ResNet-50V2 model in breast cancer detection using the RSNA mammography dataset. The ResNet
50V2 model is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture known for its excellent
 performance in image classification tasks. We train and evaluate the model using a large-scale dataset of
 mammography images provided by the RSNA. Our results demonstrate that the ResNet-50V2 model
 achieves high accuracy in detecting breast cancer, showcasing its potential as a valuable tool in aiding
 radiologists with timely and accurate diagnoses. The findings of this study contribute to the ongoing
 research efforts in leveraging deep learning techniques for breast cancer detection and highlight the
 potential of the ResNet-50V2 model in improving early diagnosis and treatment outcomes for breast
 cancer patients
